# Pathfinder

A computerized gambling machine for Maykabuk Casion Machines, Inc.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of Pathfinder up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
```

### Installing

To install Pathfinder:
* cd in the root directory
* yarn install or npm install
* yarn start or npm run start

This should open a browser at http://localhost:3000

The gameboard initializes and gameplay works! You can deal, rotate cards, and place them on the board. There are occasional edge-case bugs where the strike card doesn't display, and currently nothing validates that you've won. Also, wagering, leaderboards, and profiles are purely ornamental design ideas for future improvement iterations.
